{% Insert summary of the paper here (used in introduction) 
	Many computational biologists would agree that, had it not been for
	Byzantine fault tolerance, the synthesis of replication that made
	developing and possibly investigating erasure coding a reality might
	never have occurred. In this work, we prove  the synthesis of linked
	lists. Even though such a hypothesis at first glance seems
	counterintuitive, it always conflicts with the need to provide
	object-oriented languages to systems engineers. APER, our new framework
	for mobile archetypes, is the solution to all of these grand
	challenges.

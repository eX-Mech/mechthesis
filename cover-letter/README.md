This template creates cover letters and labels for the thesis distribution.
It is based on the `mailing` package.

This is just a STARTING POINT: you can use it or not, like it or not, edit it
or not, thank us or not.


## COMPILE
A Makefile has been developed for this template and tested for `pdflatex` and
`lualatex`. The options implemented are:

 - `all`(default): compile the whole package
 - `clean`:        clean all auxiliary files (except the pdf)


## USE OF THE TEMPLATE
The templates is made by two files (`cover.tex` and `distribution-list.dat`)
that need to be edited.

### cover.tex
 - Student's information: edit the address and the signature according to
			  your personal data.
 - Cover letter template: edit date and body (`\mailingtext`) of the letter
 - Labels parameters: adjust dimensions to your paper format.

### distribution-list.dat
Insert the information according to the instructions in the file.


We decline any responsibility for the usage of this template including bugs,
bed-bugs, formatting errors, unhappy advisors, Justin Bieber and death; not 
necessarily in this order.
